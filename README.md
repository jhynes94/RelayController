# Grow System Relay Controller

A friend needs a relay controller to run his grow system. He wants to be able to set the on times and off times of certain relays (Which are lights and pumps). These need to be able to be set on a weekly schedule.

To lower cost and complexity, the entire design is done with a sdcard that stores the opening and closing times (which can be changed with a computer). Also a real time clock to know when to turn off and on.
